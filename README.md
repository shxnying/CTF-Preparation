Welcome to my CTF challenge solutions repository! This repository contains my approaches and solutions to various CTF challenges. These challenges are tutorials/trial challenges designed to prepare for actual CTF competition.

As a beginner in the field of cybersecurity, my approaches may not be the most optimized, but I am documenting my thought processes and the things I have learned through these challenges
